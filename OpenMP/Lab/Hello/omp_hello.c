* OpenMP Example - Hello World - C/C++ Version
* FILE: omp_hello.c
* DESCRIPTION:
*   In this simple example, the master thread forks a parallel region.
*   All threads in the team obtain their unique thread number and print it.
*   The master thread only prints the total number of threads.  Two OpenMP
*   library routines are used to obtain the number of threads and each
*   thread's number.
